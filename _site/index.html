<small>

- I joined Xanadu consultancy (e-commerce company) in 2014 as a Data Scientist.
 - First worked in the "Data Analytics" team (2 years).
 - Then worked in the "Data Products" team (~9 months).
- Last year I moved to New Zealand and worked as a Business Analyst/Data Scientist for Pacific Radiology (diagnostic imaging services company).

<small>
<b><u>Example projects I delivered as a Data Scientist</b></u>

- Haproxy log file analytics and Big-data: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Setup processes in MongoDB, later Google-Bigquery. Granular data of large volume (50+GB per day of user website sessions) on the platform (matchbook.com).
 - Many example reports derived from analytics on this semi-structured data (ie. Apple watch tracking and mobile tracking, blog readers, fraud reporting (via linked sessions), predicting API users based on requests made etc.). 
- R package development (e.g. IP address conversion etc.) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Personalization projects (e.g. Twitter app, betting statistics and user skill) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Data analytics migration from MySQL to Cassandra and developing Spark processes. I created python modules that were distributed in Spark (ie. custom pandas functions), also acted as knowledge source of database structure. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- CRM tracking via Salesforce APIS in python <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Data analytics innovation lab (DAIL): I developed a "Betting Prices analytics" app (NFTN tool) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

<small>

<b><u>My impact in the Data-Products team as a Data Scientist !</b></u>

- Bonus platform engine: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Scrum team (two data scientists, Java engineer and product owner)
 - Gamification and personalization based on criteria and customer interactions 
 - Specifically I worked on "DBStreams". This involved converting MySQL and Cassandra queries into python functions that could be run to retreive a "stream" of historical user interaction events stored in the database (combination of MySQL and Cassandra as an event stream of JSON objects) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Automation of Knime Workflows: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Automating manual knime analytics workflows to credit customers if they achieved the correct criteria (example image above).
  - Python running "KNIME" logic, engaging with the API endpoint to credit accounts automatically.
- Developing a Python analytics package for easier access to re-usable and tested queries. I worked on functions such as commision calculations, pnl etc. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Built a HR database of all employees (clinicians and administration): <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Importance in terms of FTE and productivity analyis.
 - Remuneration of 800 + employees, ability to adapt to deliver important projects.
- Cost pricing model (extraction in R, model in Excel). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- "Ops pack" and "Finance pack" in Tableau. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - A lot of reporting work  was being outsourced to affiliates. I brought R knowledge to the company to run TSQL procedures and build our own reporting in house.
- Voice of the patient. Text messages to customers. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Helped people in the company (specifically in IT and operations) interested in data analytics and BI (ie. Jupyter notebooks and R). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

##### 1. Career history and skills relevant to Nuritas

<img src="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/images/masthead/circos-genome-biology-mirna.png" width="580px"/> 
<small>

Background in Genetics, Immunology and Data Science including working building commerical data science applications and experience working with clinicians in New Zealand.

Up to date and skille in some of the best in class tools in data analytics.

In the next section I'll describe in more detail my analytics toolset and why I feel I'm a good match for the bioinformatician role at Nuritas.

## 3. Ideas !

<img src="/public/img/ideas.png" width="400px"/> <img src="/public/img/idea_man.png" width="400px"/>

<small>

In this section I've outlined some ideas and processes I've helped implement in previous roles.

I'm sure there will be many more ideas after discussion with the bioinformatics team.

I'd like to think of myself as a creative thinker to build the best solution for the customer.

</small>

##### Ideas 

<img src="/public/img/ideas.png" width="100px"/> <img src="/public/img/idea_man.png" width="100px"/>
<small>

- Build custom RShiny apps and help train biologists with clear documentation of how to use them and incorporate their requirements. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Use DJango and Rshiny together. I have a working prototype that is built using Django and Nginx for authorization, allowing the use of open source RShiny in production. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Creating high quality automation pipelines in Python with good quality Data-Engineering for the AI platform <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Leverage biologists experience with R. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Bioinformatics and statistical packages developed by us and distributed to the team.
 - Build demos of analysis in Python and R.
- Collect all data !  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - I have some experience with parsing unstructured data (NLP) and web-scraping in python, and we could store this data in more structured formats in MongoDB for instance. This could represented external data sources.
 - Collect data directly from the lab (ie. google sheets API for example), make this available for the biological scientists.
- I'm ready to adapt to new challenges and help engineer high quality data and perform analytics to derive value. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

</small>

##### Previous experience implementing ideas and fresh approaches.

<img src="/public/img/ideas.png" width="100px"/> <img src="/public/img/idea_man.png" width="100px"/>
<small>

- Xanadu Consultancy: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Knime workflows to bring value straight away by interacting with marketing and adopting an agile approach.
 - NFTN app, to help customers make informated betting decisions, helped the marketing team to drive commissions on the site. Gap in market. 
 - Identifying client IP address and user agents from raw log file data to identify fraudlent activity on the site
- Pacific Radiology: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Brought lots of ideas to the team in NZ.
 - Collecting manual entered data from all areas of the business, with more data from leading to more valuable insights and productivity in diagnostic imaging branches.
 - Another solution involved automating extracts to Tableau which significantly increased performance of reports.
