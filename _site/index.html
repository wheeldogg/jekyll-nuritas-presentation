##### 1. Career history and skills relevant to Nuritas

<img src="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/images/masthead/circos-genome-biology-mirna.png" width="580px"/> 
<small>

Background in biological sciences (mostly through college MSC and BSc) and data science (HDip and commerical experience).

I've worked on various data sets using different analytics tools and hopefully can apply the skills I've learned in the biological sciences domain.

In the next section I'll describe in more detail the tools used and why I feel I'm a good match for the bioinformatician role.

## 2. Position Profile !

<small>
The role is for a bioinformatician and I feel this represents data science where the domain is biology.
</small>

## 3. Ideas !

<img src="/public/img/ideas.png" width="400px"/> <img src="/public/img/idea_man.png" width="400px"/>

<small>

In this part I've outlined some ideas and processes I've helped implement in previous roles.


I'm sure there will be many more ideas after discussion with the bioinformatics team shortly.

Ideas 

<img src="/public/img/ideas.png" width="100px"/> <img src="/public/img/idea_man.png" width="100px"/>
<small>

- Build custom RShiny apps and help train biologists with clear documentation of how to use them and incorporate their requirements. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Furthermore, we could imbed these in Django directly and build a suite of Rshiny bioinformatics tools and visualizations. Working prototype now that is built using Django and Nginx for authorization, allowing the use of open source RShiny. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Creating high quality automation pipelines in Python (Data-Engineering) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Biologists often have experience with R. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Thus deploy an R package (customized and unit tested by us including statistical analyses), that biologists can install directly and perform an analysis they often require.
 - Can deploy Rstudio on AWS or Nuritas servers (Quick demo as required)
- Collect all data !  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - I could contribute by building a database in MongoDB (or other) for unstructured data. This could for example be scraped peptides of interest in target phase.
 - Collect data from the lab (ie. google sheets API for example), store this data in a database to make more information available for the biological scientists.
- Delivery of automated emails with attached Excel workbooks containing important information.  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Previous experience implementing ideas.

<img src="/public/img/ideas.png" width="100px"/> <img src="/public/img/idea_man.png" width="100px"/>
<small>

- Xanadu Consultancy: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Knime workflows to bring value straight away by interacting with marketing and adopting an agile approach.
 - NFTN app, to help customers make informated betting decisions.
 - Identifying client IP address and user agents from raw log file data to identify fraudlent activity on the site
- Pacific Radiology: <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 - Brought lots of ideas to the team in NZ.
 - Collecting manual entered data from all areas of the business and interacting with teams to ensure the data follows certain rules and privalges. More data from different sources leading to more insights.
 - Another solution involved automating extracts to Tableau which significantly increased performance of reports.
