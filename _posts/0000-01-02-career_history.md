##### 1. Career history and skills relevant to Nuritas

Background in biological sciences (mostly through college MSC and BSc) and data science (HDip and commerical experience).

I've worked on various data sets using different analytics tools and hopefully can apply the skills I've learned in the biological sciences domain.

In the next section I'll describe in more detail the tools used and why I feel I'm a good match for the bioinformatician role.
