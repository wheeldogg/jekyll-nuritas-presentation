<b><u>Example projects I delivered as a Data Scientist</b></u>

- Haproxy log file analytics and Big-data: {% fragment %}
 - Setup processes in MongoDB, later Google-Bigquery. Granular data of large volume (50+GB per day of user website sessions) on the platform (matchbook.com).
 - Many example reports derived from analytics on this semi-structured data (ie. Apple watch tracking and mobile tracking, blog readers, fraud reporting (via linked sessions), predicting API users based on requests made etc.). 
- R package development (e.g. IP address conversion etc.) {% fragment %}
- Personalization projects (e.g. Twitter app, betting statistics and user skill) {% fragment %}
- Data analytics migration from MySQL to Cassandra and developing Spark processes. I created python modules that were distributed in Spark (ie. custom pandas functions), also acted as knowledge source of database structure. {% fragment %}
- CRM tracking via Salesforce APIS in python {% fragment %}
- Data analytics innovation lab (DAIL): I developed a "Betting Prices analytics" app (NFTN tool) {% fragment %}

<b><u>My impact in the Data-Products team as a Data Scientist !</b></u>

- Bonus platform engine: {% fragment %}
 - Scrum team (two data scientists, Java engineer and product owner)
 - Gamification and personalization based on criteria and customer interactions 
 - Specifically I worked on "DBStreams". This involved converting MySQL and Cassandra queries into python functions that could be run to retreive a "stream" of historical user interaction events stored in the database (combination of MySQL and Cassandra as an event stream of JSON objects) {% fragment %}
- Automation of Knime Workflows: {% fragment %}
  - Automating manual knime analytics workflows to credit customers if they achieved the correct criteria (example image above).
  - Python running "KNIME" logic, engaging with the API endpoint to credit accounts automatically.
- Developing a Python analytics package for easier access to re-usable and tested queries. I worked on functions such as commision calculations, pnl etc. {% fragment %}

<img src="http://mkweb.bcgsc.ca/images/masthead/circos-genome-biology-mirna.png" width="580px"/> 
<small>

Background in Genetics, Immunology and Data Science including working building commerical data science applications and experience working with clinicians in New Zealand.

Up to date and skille in some of the best in class tools in data analytics.

In the next section I'll describe in more detail my analytics toolset and why I feel I'm a good match for the bioinformatician role at Nuritas.
