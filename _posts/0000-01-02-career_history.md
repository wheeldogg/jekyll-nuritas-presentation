 - Setup processes in MongoDB, later Google Bigquery. Using granular data (Sessions) for determining how users were interactin on the website. The aim was to help marketing understand uptake of promotions (example use of the Apple watch app among many other questions). {% fragment %}
- R package for data analytics team. {% fragment %}
- Personalization (e.g. twitter, personal news feed ) {% fragment %}
- Migration of BI reports from MySQL to Cassandra and developing Spark processes. {% fragment %}
- Many other data projects, including fraud detection alerts (Linking users report), LTV, Churn, Twitter prototypes {% fragment %}
- Prices analytics (NFTN tool) (Example below) {% fragment %}

<small>

Background in biological sciences (mostly college) and data science (commerical environements). {% fragment %}

I've worked on a number of varying data sets and I'm hopeful that the next domain will be again Biology which was my passion in getting into sciecen initially.  {% fragment %}

In the next section when reviewing the position description I'll describe in more detail the tools used. {% fragment %}
