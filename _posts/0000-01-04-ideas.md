In this section I've outlined some ideas and processes I've helped implement in previous roles.

I'm sure there will be many more ideas after discussion with the bioinformatics team.

I'd like to think of myself as a creative thinker to build the best solution for the customer.

##### Ideas

<small>

- Build custom RShiny apps and help train biologists with clear documentation of how to use them and incorporate their requirements. {% fragment %}
 - Use DJango and Rshiny together. I have a working prototype that is built using Django and Nginx for authorization, allowing the use of open source RShiny in production. {% fragment %}
- Creating high quality automation pipelines in Python with good quality Data-Engineering for the AI platform {% fragment %}
- Leverage biologists experience with R. {% fragment %}
 - Bioinformatics and statistical packages developed by us and distributed to the team.
 - Build demos of analysis in Python and R.
- Collect all data !  {% fragment %}
 - I have some experience with parsing unstructured data (NLP) and web-scraping in python, and we could store this data in more structured formats in MongoDB for instance. This could represented external data sources.
 - Collect data directly from the lab (ie. google sheets API for example), make this available for the biological scientists.
- I'm ready to adapt to new challenges and help engineer high quality data and perform analytics to derive value. {% fragment %}

 - Knime workflows to bring value straight away by interacting with marketing and adopting an agile approach.
 - NFTN app, to help customers make informated betting decisions, helped the marketing team to drive commissions on the site. Gap in market. 
 - Identifying client IP address and user agents from raw log file data to identify fraudlent activity on the site
- Pacific Radiology: {% fragment %}
 - Brought lots of ideas to the team in NZ.
 - Collecting manual entered data from all areas of the business, with more data from leading to more valuable insights and productivity in diagnostic imaging branches.
 - Another solution involved automating extracts to Tableau which significantly increased performance of reports.
