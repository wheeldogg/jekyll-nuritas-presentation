In this part I've outlined some of ideas I've had previously and helped implement.


I will have more ideas after learning more about the bioinformatics team with you.

Ideas 


<small>

- Build custom RShiny apps and help train biologists with clear documentation of how they work. {% fragment %}
 - Furthermore, we could imbed these in Django directly and build a suite of Rshiny bioinformatics tools and visualizations https://github.com/mfcovington/djangocms-shiny-app {% fragment %}
- Creating high quality automation pipelines using Python together with R in some cases {% fragment %}
- Biologists often have experience with R. {% fragment %}
 - Thus deploy an R package (customized and unit tested by us including statistical analyses), that biologists can install directly and perform an analysis they often require. {% fragment %}
 - Can deploy Rstudio on AWS or Nuritas servers (Quick demo as required) {% fragment %}
 - Collect all data {% fragment %}
 - Possibly contribute with building a database in MongoDB (or other) of unstructured sources in the "Target" phase. {% fragment %}
 - Collect data from the lab (ie. google sheets API or other example), store this data in a database to make more information available for the biological scientists. {% fragment %}
- Delivery of automated emails of Excel workbooks that deliver updated information of interest to the team. {% fragment %}

Previous experience implementing ideas.

<small>

- Xanadu Consultancy.
 - Knime workflows to bring value straight away by interacting with marketing and adopting an agile approach.
 - NFTN app, to help customers make informated betting decisions.
 - Identifying client IP address user agenets and from raw log files to identify fraudlent activity.

- Pacific Radiology.
 - Collecting manual entered data from all areas of the busines and interacting with teams to ensure the data follows certain rules and privalges.
 - The value is that once we have more data we can find more insights.
 - Another solution involved automating extracts to Tableau which significantly increased performance of reports.
